This repository contains two code implemented in JavaScript.

## Task 1: Bias Simulator

The Bias Simulator is a program that simulates an event with biased outcomes based on given probabilities. It calculates the probabilities for each outcome, performs a simulation for a specified number of occurrences, and provides the statistics of the simulated event.

- Implementation: The implementation code is available in the `task1` directory.
- Usage: Refer to the `README.md` file in the `task1` directory for detailed instructions.

## Task 2: Evaluate Expressions using API

The Evaluate Expressions program is a program that accepts multiple mathematical expressions and evaluates each of them using a public Web API. It displays the result of each expression on the console.

- Implementation: The implementation code is available in the `task2` directory.
- Usage: Refer to the `README.md` file in the `task2` directory for detailed instructions.
